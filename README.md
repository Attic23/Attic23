Hi, and welcome to my github! 

I am a recent UMD graduate working in the medical device engineering and mechatronics in DC. This is a repository of projects I have been working on during my courses at Maryland, as well as tangential individual projects. 

I can be contacted via email at atticus480@gmail.com or a.cameron@loccioni.com , or by text at (443)-844-7089.
